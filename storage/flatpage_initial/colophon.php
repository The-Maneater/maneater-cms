    <h1>Website Colophon</h1>

    <p><strong>July 9, 2014</strong></p>
    <p>This site now features a responsive layout, which means it will automatically adjust how content is displayed based on the size of your web browser window. That means a seamless reading experience regardless of whether you're on a desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.</p>

    <p>I'll just get straight to the point. This website uses <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, which is built on the <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> framework.  Cool, huh?</p>

    <p>A new colophon is coming soon to themaneater.com. It will document the site in a very detailed manner.</p>
    <p>Until then, here are some quick credits.</p>
    <p>Development of this site over the past two years has been led by Mike Tigas, Justin Myers and Allan J. Vestal.</p>

    <p><i><b>Note:</b> Through September 20, 2009, a message from former Assistant Online Editor Mike Tigas was displayed on this page. For now, I will leave the message on this page, in the interest of accurately documenting the site's past. ~AJV</i></p>

    <p>A colophon, in publishing parlance, is a page of production notes about the typefaces, design, software, printing and whatever gory technical details one would ever wish to know about the book at hand.</p>
    <p>Someday soon, this page will grow up to be a big, strong, page that discusses the design and programming elements behind this website.</p>
    <p>Until then, please see my <a href="/pages/2008/02/08/launch/">note regarding the new website's launch</a>, which links to an informal series I've written regarding the development of this site.</p>
