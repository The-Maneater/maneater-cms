        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Maneater stylebook was first printed in February 1998, revised by Editor-in-Chief Jennifer Dlouhy and Managing Editor Kelly Wiese.</p>
        <p>For this, the 17th edition, revisions were made by Copy Chief George Roberson, Managing Editor Katherine Knott and Editor-in-Chief Elizabeth Loutfi.</p>
        <h2>Inside</h2>
        <p>The first portion of the guide is dedicated to <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/reporters/info_pages/general-policies/">general policies and administrative guidelines</a> for The Maneater.</p>
        <p>The second portion is dedicated to <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/reporters/info_pages/maneater-stylebook/">entries much like one would find in the AP Stylebook</a>. These are guidelines for copy-editing decisions at The Maneater and MOVE Magazine. Editors, writers, designers, photographers and multimedia staff should be familiar with these.</p>
        <p>The third section is geared to accommodate the specific styles of <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/reporters/info_pages/maneater-stylebook-crime/">crime</a>, <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/reporters/info_pages/maneater-stylebook-move/">MOVE</a> and <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/reporters/info_pages/maneater-stylebook-sports/">sports</a> copy.</p>
        <p>This is followed by the <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/reporters/info_pages/maneater-stylebook-lgbt/">National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association supplement of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender terminology</a>. The LGBT Supplement has also been updated to mirror the <a href="http://lgbtq.missouri.edu/">LGBTQ Resource Center</a>'s Definitions and Terminology sheet. </p>
        <p>The final section is a <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/reporters/info_pages/social-media/">supplement of social media policy, conventions and guidelines</a>.</p>
        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <p>This stylebook should be the first source for determining style for any nonadvertising copy for The Maneater and MOVE Magazine. The AP Stylebook should be consulted next, followed by “Working With Words” and the AP-authorized dictionary, Webster’s New World College Dictionary.</p>
        <p>In cases in which a style question is not answered by any of these resources, the editor-in-chief will make a style decision that will be entered into the master copy of this stylebook.</p>

        <h5 id="A">A</h5>

        <p><strong>abortion</strong> Do not use <em>pro-choice</em> or <em>pro-life</em> because there is no “anti-choice” or “pro-death.” Instead, use <em>abortion opponent</em> or <em>abortion-rights advocate</em>. One is either for or against the rights to an abortion. The appropriate adjectives are <em>anti-abortion-rights</em> and <em>pro-abortion-rights</em>. Acceptable usage includes <em>reproductive rights</em>, which are not the synonymous with “abortion rights” and include other forms of birth control.</p>
        <p><strong>abbreviations</strong> Use sparingly.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In addresses, <em>street</em>, <em>avenue</em> and <em>boulevard</em> are abbreviated only when a street number is given: <em>Bob lives at 123 Maple St., but Amy lives on Pine Street.</em></li>
            <li>In general, abbreviations of one or two letters take periods: <em>600 B.C., U.N., a.m., p.m.</em> Exceptions to this rule include: <em>AM, FM, 35mm camera, AP Stylebook, IQ, TV.</em></li>
            <li>Abbreviations of three or more letters do not take periods unless they would otherwise spell out an unrelated word: <em>FBI, YMCA, c.o.d.</em></li>
            <li>Don’t use acronyms unless they’re obvious from the first reference. If an acronym is easily discernible from the name of the organization, refer to the organization without any additional acronym or other information in parentheses. <em>The Residence Halls Association is responsible for dividing funds between the 18 residence halls on campus. Every year, RHA is responsible …</em></li>
            <li>Avoid alphabet soup. Use terms like <em>the group</em>, <em>the organization</em> or <em>the association</em> whenever possible.</li>
            <li>As of May 1, 2014, stat abbreviations are no longer used in the body text. Write out the state name after the city: <em>Columbus, Ohio; Buffalo, New York</em>. The instances where abbreviations are still appropriate are after politicians' party affiliations (<em>Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.</em>) and in lists. </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>academic degrees</strong> Always use <em>degree</em> after the appropriate designation: <em>She received a bachelor’s degree in history; He earned a master's degree from MU</em>. Use <em>doctoral degree</em>, not “doctorate.” Do not use an abbreviated term such as B.J., B.S., M.A. or Ph.D. unless it is part of a series of names in which spelling out the full titles would be cumbersome. Otherwise, use <em>bachelor’s degree</em> or <em>master’s degree</em> as general terms.</p>
        <p><strong>Academic Exploration and Advising Services</strong> Academic advisers who work in the <strong>Student Success Center</strong>. Do not use except in quotes.</p>
        <p><strong>accents</strong> Use accent marks in proper nouns, never in words like "resume" or "cliche."</p>
        <p><strong>acronyms</strong> Spell out the full name of the group whenever possible on first reference. Common groups such as MSA and ASUM may be abbreviated in headlines and leads for conciseness, but they must be fully spelled out on first reference. Never follow a group’s full name with its abbreviation set off by dashes or parentheses. If the acronym needs such explanation, it should not be used. Avoid acronyms that would be unfamiliar to readers. Right: <em>The Missouri Students Association will give them $10. MSA will …</em> Wrong: <em>The Missouri Students Association (MSA) will …</em> Exceptions: In direct quotes, do not spell out an acronym if the speaker did not say it. Certain group names, such as <strong>STRIPES</strong>, should never be spelled out.</p>
        <p><strong>Activity and Recreation Center</strong> The city’s recreation center, located at the corner of Ash Street and Clinkscales Road. ARC is acceptable on second reference.</p>
        <p><strong>Ad Sheet</strong> The yellow weekly coupon/advertisement magazine distributed on campus and throughout the city.</p>
        <p><strong>addresses</strong> Identify places by their addresses, with the following exceptions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In obituaries, only use the city to identify the deceased. Thieves often read obituaries to find out which houses will be left unguarded and when.</li>
            <li>Use a building’s address only if it adds something to the story. Addresses should be used if the story discusses an upcoming event being held there, construction being done there or a place of business. An address can also be used if the story concerns the particular location of the building.</li>
            <li>The address of a home where a crime was committed should not be included. Only an approximate area should be written: <em>A residence near the intersection of Ninth Street and Fourth Avenue; a residence on the 400 block of Ninth Street.</em></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Abbreviate <em>street (St.)</em>, <em>avenue (Ave.)</em> and <em>boulevard (Blvd.)</em> in complete addresses.</p>
        <p><strong>African American (n.), African-American (adj.)</strong> Use <em>black</em> as an adjective as opposed to “African-American,” but do not alter quotes if sources use <em>African-American</em> (adj.) or <em>African American</em> (n.). See <strong>black</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>AIDS</strong> See <strong>HIV/AIDS</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>alumna, alumnae, alumnus, alumni</strong> <em>MU graduate</em> is preferred. Never use “alum.” 1. <em>alumna</em>: one graduate who is a woman; 2. <em>alumnae</em>: several graduates who are women (all must be women); 3. <em>alumnus</em>: one graduate who is a man; 4. <em>alumni</em>: several graduates who are men or a group of graduates containing men and women.</p>
        <p><strong>Alumni Association</strong> Host of <strong>Homecoming</strong> and sponsor of <strong>Mizzou ’39</strong>, among many other things. Always capitalize. Only “Mizzou Alumni Association” if the story references more than one alumni association. Never “MAA” or “AA.” On second reference, <em>the association</em> is acceptable. The <em>Alumni Association Student Board</em> should be condensed to <em>AASB</em> on second reference and in headlines.</p>
        <p><strong>alumni center</strong> There are two alumni centers in Columbia. The one across from Jesse Hall is properly called the Donald W. Reynolds Visitor and Alumni Center, but use <em>Reynolds Alumni Center</em> on first reference. On second reference, <em>alumni center</em> is suitable. The alumni center is named after a graduate of the MU School of Journalism and founder of the Donrey Media Group. See <strong>Reynolds Alumni Center</strong>. The other center, located on Carrie Francke Drive off Stadium Boulevard, is the Old Alumni Center.</p>
        <p><strong>a.m.</strong> Always use lowercase form. Use a space to separate the numerals from <em>a.m.</em> Avoid redundancies such as <em>7 a.m. Tuesday morning</em>. Use <em>midnight</em> instead of “12 a.m.”</p>
        <p><strong>anonymity</strong> See the policy section on the use of anonymous sources in all cases. An anonymous source must be identified as such in the following way: <em>(a source), who asked to remain anonymous, …</em> “(A source)” can be replaced with a suitable title: <em>A member of Delta Tau Delta, who asked that his name be withheld, …</em> For clarity’s sake, an anonymous source or person used repeatedly throughout an article (particularly a feature) may be identified using a pseudonym. Again, check with the editors first.</p>
        <p><strong>apostrophes</strong> When used with abbreviated years or decades, ensure the tail of the apostrophe is pointed to the left, the side on which characters were removed: <em>Mizzou ’39</em>, <em>the Roaring ’20s</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Arts and Science Building</strong> Use the uppercase form of “Building” because it is part of the formal title. Note the plural "Arts" and singular “Science.”</p>
        <p><strong>Asian American (n.), Asian-American (adj.)</strong> Generally, use “Asian” as a modifier. Be specific. If someone is Korean, Chinese, Japanese, etc., specify that in the story.</p>
        <p><strong>Aspen Heights</strong> Luxury student housing complex located on Aspen Heights Parkway. Built on the former site of Regency Mobile Home Park, Aspen Heights purchased the site and asked the city to rezone its land for high-end residential development. Labor disputes partially delayed its construction, leaving more than a 100 students trapped in leases without a home when the complex opened in fall 2013. The complex remains infamous for crimes taking place there regularly.</p>
        <p><strong>Associated Students of the University of Missouri</strong> Student lobbying group. <em>ASUM</em> is acceptable on second reference or in a headline. The Columbia, Rolla and Kansas City campuses have ASUM chapters. St. Louis was previously not a member but has since joined. Unless a student working with ASUM is the legislative director or assistant director, he or she is a lobbyist, not a legislative assistant. In winter 2013, MSA adopted MU’s representative onto its executive cabinet.</p>
        <p><strong>attribution</strong> The order of attribution is “[Quote],” [title] [person] said: <em>“They’re great,” spokesman Truman Tiger said</em>. For titles of more than five words, use this order: “[Quote],” said [person], [title]. See <strong>titles</strong>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Always use the past-tense <em>said</em> with quotes or paraphrases — never “giggled,” “laughed,” “moaned” or “sighed.” <em>Said</em> by itself assumes a spoken (in person or over the phone) interview. A reporter should always strive for a face-to-face interview. However, if alternative means are needed to conduct an interview, every attribution of that interview must be identified as such.</li>
            <li>Use <em>said in an email</em> for all information quoted in emails. </li>
            <li>When quoting from a printed source, use <em>according</em> to. The words following <em>according</em> to should always be as specific as possible. Vague terms such as “a document” make the reader suspicious. Instead, say something like “a government document detailing FBI protocol.” Letters, memos and the like can “state” information. In the rare case of lifting a quote from a news release, the attribution should be like this: <em>"I really do try my best not to use quotes from news releases,” reporter Tim Smith stated in a news release</em>.</li>
            <li>Use <em>according to [organization]’s Facebook page</em> or <em>said in a tweet</em> when using social networking websites as a source. Facebook, Twitter and other social networking websites should not be used as sources when the reporter can avoid it.</li>
            <li>If a vital source cannot be reached for comment, simply say that: <em>Joe Smith could not be reached for comment.</em> In some pieces, we want to emphasize we tried desperately to get “the other side of the story” or hear from a vital source. In those very rare cases, it may be appropriate to write: <em>Joe Smith did not return several phone calls regarding …</em></li>
            <li>If a source was reached but chose not to comment, say <em>Joe Smith declined to comment.</em> Yes, the preposition is important.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>auditoriums</strong> Can be used as locations. Capitalize names of auditoriums: <em>the speech in Allen Auditorium.</em> Jesse Auditorium is located in Jesse Hall. Jesse Wrench Auditorium is located in Memorial Union. To avoid confusion, specify that Wrench Auditorium is in Memorial Union when appropriate. Using <em>Wrench Auditorium</em> on first reference can help to further avoid any confusion.</p>
        <h5 id="B">B</h5>

        <p><strong>Battle High School</strong> Formally called Muriel Williams Battle High School, but <em>Battle High School</em> is acceptable on first reference. The school opened in 2013 as part of Columbia Public Schools. Its mascot is a Spartan.</p>
        <p><strong>black</strong> Use <em>black</em> as an adjective as opposed to “African-American,” but do not alter quotes if sources use <em>African-American</em> (adj.) or <em>African American</em> (n.). Never use the collective noun “blacks”: <em>The black community rallied behind MSA presidential candidate Corby Jones</em>. In opinion pieces, “Black" is acceptable to capitalize as an adjective.</p>
        <p><strong>Black Culture Center</strong> See <strong>Gaines/Oldham Black Culture Center</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>black studies program</strong> Not “African-American studies program.”</p>
        <p><strong>Blackboard</strong> The website on which MU students can check grades, submit assignments, email classmates and obtain additional course information. Students log in with their PawPrints.</p>
        <p><strong>Blue Book</strong> Familiar term for the Official Manual of the State of Missouri, which has appeared in green and mauve hardbound editions in addition to the familiar blue one. Also available online at www.sos.mo.gov/bluebook. Not to be confused with blue books, which students use on essay exams. </p>
        <p><strong>blue lights</strong> A common name for the emergency phones found on campus. Use <em>blue light emergency phone</em> on first reference. <em>Blue lights</em> or <em>emergency phones</em>  are acceptable on second reference. <em>Blue lights</em> is acceptable in headlines.</p>
        <p><strong>Board of Elections Commissioners</strong> The appointed board in charge of MSA elections. BEC is acceptable on second reference and in headlines. It is led by the BEC chairwoman, along with her vice chairmen. Per its bylaws, the BEC is independent of MSA and its representatives may not hold simultaneous offices, though this rule has been repeatedly broken. The board creates the <em>BEC Handbook</em> before each election cycle.</p>
        <p><strong>boards</strong> When referring to a board, use the pronoun “it” and not “they.” <em>Board of Curators</em> is capitalized; <em>board of directors</em> is not.</p>
        <p><strong>Boone County Circuit Court</strong> Also <em>Circuit Court</em>, <em>the court</em>. Boone and Callaway counties make up the 13th Judicial Circuit. The Circuit Court has three judicial classifications: circuit judges, associate circuit judges and municipal judges. The first two hear all civil, criminal, juvenile and probate cases. Municipal judges hear cases involving city ordinances.</p>
        <p><strong>Boone County Commission</strong> Also <em>County Commission</em>, <em>the commission</em>. This is the legislative and executive body for Boone County. The southern district is District I and the northern is District II, but always use directional designations in publication. Columbia is in the northern district. The presiding commissioner holds a four-year term, and the other two serve for two years each. Capitalize <em>commissioner</em> when used as a title before someone’s name: <em>Commissioner Keith Schnarre: the commissioner.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Boone County Courthouse</strong> Note the difference from County-City Building and Daniel Boone City Building. Located at 705 E. Walnut St., the building has columns in front of it.</p>
        <p><strong>Boone County Fairground</strong> Not “fairgrounds” because there’s only one. Located just north of Columbia on U.S. 63.</p>
        <p><strong>Boone County towns</strong> Do not need "Missouri" specified. Incorporated cities and towns in Boone County: Ashland, Centralia, Columbia, Hallsville, Harrisburg, Hartsburg, McBaine, Rocheport and Sturgeon. Unincorporated areas in Boone County: Brown’s Station, Claysville, Easley, Englewood, Hinton, Huntsdale, Lupus, Midway, Murry, Pierpoint, Prathersville, Ruggs, Rucker, Wilton and Woodlandville. Correct: <em>Hartsburg</em>. Incorrect: <em>Hartsburg, Missouri.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Boone County Fire Protection District</strong> Refer to the county’s volunteer fire services by this term only, not by “fire department.” On second reference, use <em>the district</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Boone County Sheriff’s Department</strong> Note the apostrophe. <em>The sheriff’s department</em> is acceptable on subsequent references.</p>
        <p><strong>Boone Hospital Center</strong> Located at 1600 E. Broadway. The hospital, formerly Boone County Hospital, is governed by a five-member board of trustees. It was leased to Christian Health Services, a private group from St. Louis, for 10 years. Christian Health Services, now Barnes Jewish Christian, is in charge of the hospital’s day-to-day operations while the county retains ownership.</p>
        <p><strong>Boonville</strong> Not “Booneville.” Located in Cooper County.</p>
        <p><strong>Brady and Anne Deaton Institute</strong> Officially the Brady and Anne Deaton Institute for University Leadership in International Development, <em>Brady and Anne Deaton Institute</em> is suitable on first reference. <em>The institute</em> thereafter. Directed by the former chancellor and his wife, the institute is based in Ellis Library and focuses on global food security, water safety and environmental sustainability.</p>
        <p><strong>Brady Commons</strong> Until 2009, Brady Commons was one of the two student unions at MU. The building was torn down in June 2009 and replaced by the <strong>MU Student Center</strong> in 2011. The building was named after Thomas Allan Brady, a former MU dean.</p>
        <p><strong>Brady Deaton</strong> Retired as <strong>chancellor</strong> in November 2013 to direct the <strong>Brady and Anne Deaton Institute</strong>. Deaton was largely credited for expanding MU’s international reach during his administrative tenure and focuses intently on it as director of the institute he and his wife founded at MU following his retirement as chancellor.</p>
        <p><strong>Broadway</strong> Always referred to as <em>Broadway</em>. When applicable, use west and east designations: <em>100 W. Broadway, 1600 E. Broadway</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Brookside</strong> Umbrella term for the series of luxury student housing developments in Columbia owned by the Odle family. Unlike other luxury student housing complexes in Columbia, Brookside is owned and operated locally. Bruce Odle and his sons, Jon and Nathan, also operate Trittenbach Development, which owns many commercial properties throughout the city. The Odles are notoriously media shy, especially following the media frenzy and speculation surrounding the fire that occurred during construction at its complex on College Avenue in summer 2012. If referring to a specific location, specify in which complex it is. There are three: <em>Brookside Downtown</em>, located on South Tenth Street; <em>Brookside on College</em> (“Midtown”), located on East Walnut Street; and <em>Brookside Townhomes</em>, located on West Old Plank Road. The Odles also own <em>Bengal Ridge</em>, though this is not a luxury complex and is distanced from the Brookside brand.</p>
        <p><strong>Business Loop 70</strong> Always spell out. When referring to direction, use: <em>Business Loop 70 E., Business Loop 70 W.</em> Specific addresses are the same style.</p>
        <p><strong>bylines</strong> Follow this order: writer’s name, return, writer’s designation.</p>
        <p>Writer’s designations: <em>Reporter</em>, <em>Staff Writer</em> (a reporter becomes a staff writer on their 10th byline), <em>Senior Staff Writer</em> (after two semesters as a staff writer), <em>Assistant Editor</em> (including section title where applicable: “Assistant Sports Editor”), <em>University News Editor</em>, <em>Student Organizations Editor</em>, <em>Student Outlook Editor</em>, <em>Projects Editor</em>, <em>Opinion Editor</em>, <em>MOVE Editor</em>, <em>Sports Editor</em>, <em>Managing Editor</em> or <em>Editor-in-Chief</em>. All significant words in designations should be capitalized.</p>
        <p>If a reporter writes their ninth and 10th story for the same issue, <em>Staff Writer</em> is used for both bylines for consistency. If the production manager, production assistant, graphics assistant, online development editor, multimedia editor, photo editor or copy chief writes a story, they should be designated with their titles, as well. If the opinion editor writes a news story, they should be credited with the title <em>Associate Editor</em> to clarify the piece is not a column. If someone who is not a current MU student writes a story, <em>Special to The Maneater</em> is the appropriate designation. If two writers worked on a story together to a fairly equal degree, use this order: writers’ names (ordered alphabetically by last name), return, <em>Of The Maneater Staff</em>.</p>
        <p>For photo credits, use designations in the same way as for stories.</p>
        <p>Avoid bylines of more than two people, but three people is the maximum. If one reporter contributed to a story but not sufficiently enough to call for a double byline, the article should end with: <em>[Writer’s name] contributed to this report.</em> If several reporters contributed to a story, <em>The following staff writers contributed to this article:</em> followed by the names of those reporters, should end the article. When writing the byline for a brief or ticker, place the reporter’s name at the end of the article: make an em dash (shift + option + dash), then put a space, then the writer’s name. Place a comma after the name. Hit enter/return and then list the title in lowercase. </p>

        <p><strong>capitalization</strong> Capitalize organizational titles when the full name is given. Retain capitalization when referring to a specific body if the context makes the name of the nation, state, city, etc. unnecessary: <em>Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Department of Natural Resources, the department</em>. Capitalize official titles before a person’s name but not when the title follows a name and never when the title stands alone: <em>President Barack Obama; the U.S. president, Barack Obama; Barack Obama, president of the United States</em>. Do not capitalize a student’s year in school or position played in a sport, even before that person’s name. Do not capitalize a person’s title if it’s more of a job decision than a title: <em>manager, cook, professor</em>. Never capitalize <em>coach</em>, <em>spokesman</em> or <em>spokeswoman</em> before a name.</p>
        <p><strong>Carnahan Quadrangle</strong> This grassy area between Conley Avenue and Cornell Hall was named after late Gov. Mel Carnahan in 2003. The area, formerly the South Quadrangle, is now “The Mel Carnahan Quadrangle: Honoring Leadership in Public Service.” Refer to it as <em>the Carnahan Quadrangle</em> or <em>Carnahan Quad</em>. The quad was occupied by student protesters as part of the Concerned Student 1950 movement in November 2015. <strong>Traditions Plaza</strong>, an amphitheater and outdoor event venue on Conley Avenue, was constructed here in 2014. The area between the Tiger statue and Rollins Street is <em>Tiger Plaza</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Center for Student Involvement</strong> Located on the second floor of the MU Student Center. All MSA offices, with the exception of the <em>MSA/GPC Box Office</em>, are located there, as well as the offices of most student organizations. Formerly known as the “GOAL Office.” <em>CSI</em> is acceptable in headlines so long as it’s clear no one is talking about the long-running CBS crime series or any of its spinoffs.</p>
        <p><strong>Central Missouri Humane Society</strong> On second reference, use <em>the humane society</em> or <em>the society</em>. Appropriately located at 616 Big Bear Blvd.</p>
        <p><strong>chair, chairman, chairwoman</strong> Use <em>chair</em> only if the position is unfilled or if the person holding the position is gender nonbinary. Never use <em>chairperson</em>. Capitalize only before a name. If the person holds the position of co-chair, use a hyphen and capitalize both first letters: <em>Co-Chairwoman Young Kwon spoke at the event</em>. Use <em>chairs</em> as the plural collective unless the group is made up entirely of men or of women. In those cases, use <em>chairmen</em> and <em>chairwomen</em>, respectively.</p>
        <p><strong>chancellor</strong> Capitalize only before a name. Until the <strong>University of Missouri System</strong> was formed in 1963, MU’s chief executive was referred to as “president.” Then, when the UM System’s leader assumed that title, each campus’s leader took the title <em>chancellor</em>.</p>
        <p>Recent MU chancellors: Charles Kiesler (November 1992 - July 1996); Richard Wallace (August 1997 - September 2004); Brady Deaton (interim: September - October 2004, October 2004 - November 2013); Steve Owens (interim: November 2013 - February 2014); R. Bowen Loftin (February 2014 - November 2015); Hank Foley (interim: November 2015 - present).</p>
        <p><strong>Christmas</strong> Never abbreviate <em>Christmas</em> as “Xmas,” even in a headline. Never liken a culture’s holiday celebration to Christmas when referring to it, as in Hanukkah as the “Jewish Christmas” or Kwanzaa as the “African Christmas.” Use <em>winter break</em> or <em>intersession</em>, not “Christmas break.”</p>
        <p><strong>City Council</strong> On second reference, use <em>the council</em>. Always include "the." Capitalize <em>City Council</em> when referring to a specific council. “Council” used alone is not capitalized. Refer to people on the council as <em>councilmen</em> and <em>councilwomen</em> individually and <em>council members</em> as a collective group. Never use “councilperson.” Six wards are represented by City Council members. The council meets at 7 p.m. every other Monday.</p>
        <p><strong>class titles</strong> Always include a student's year in school. The online directory should be used to confirm, not determine, a student's year in school. It calculates grade by credit hours. However, most students prefer to be identified by length of time in school. Always lowercase a student’s year in school except at the beginning of a sentence. The Maneater does not identify students or alumni by graduation year. When quoting a student, always use the following format: <em>“I like beer,” senior Alva Nother said.</em> A graduate student is just that, not a “law student” or “med student.” Class titles should always be used for students, even if they have another title in a story, but the two do not necessarily have to be contiguous: <em>"ASUM President Ben Levin, senior, said…"</em></p>
        <p><strong>Clery release</strong> Named after the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. Capitalize “Clery."</p>
        <p><strong>cliches</strong> Avoid aggressively. Do not use in seriousness.</p>
        <p><strong>closeted</strong> Do not use the word “closeted" when describing a time in the life of an LGBTQ person or otherwise. Using the word to refer to a potentially embarrassing passion, hobby or belief stigmatizes and trivializes the experiences of LGBTQ people.</p>
        <p><strong>Coal Free Mizzou</strong> See <strong>Mizzou Energy Action Coalition</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>colleges</strong> Within MU, use <em>College of (Whatever)</em>. On second reference, use <em>the college</em> or <em>the (whatever) college</em>. MU colleges: <em>the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources</em>; <em>the College of Arts and Science</em> (note “science” is singular); <em>the Trulaske College of Business</em>; <em>the College of Education; the College of Engineering</em>; <em>the College of Human Environmental Sciences</em> (note “sciences” is plural); and <em>the College of Veterinary Medicine</em>. Do not confuse with <strong>schools</strong> within MU.</p>
        <p><strong>colon</strong> Capitalize the first word after a colon if everything following the colon is a complete sentence. If it is merely a fragment, do not capitalize the first word following the colon. In many cases, a colon will replace an em dash and suffice just as well. Although em dashes may look more emphatic or compelling, they take up more room and are incorrect to join to indecent clauses.</p>
        <p><strong>colony</strong> The term used to refer to a Greek Life organization in its initial year on campus when it has enough members to be an organization. Prior to meeting this requirement, the group is considered an interest group. For more information, see <strong>interest group</strong>. The colony must meet requirements set by ORG and its national organization before it can be recognized as a chapter at MU. Upon completion of these requirements, the colony can officially be chartered as a chapter. A colony is not considered a full member of the governing council, meaning it can neither vote at council meetings nor have members hold office in the council. See <strong>fraternities</strong> and <strong>sororities</strong> for more information and for a list of current colonies.</p>
        <p><strong>Columbian</strong> Never use to refer to people from Columbia. Use <em>Columbia residents</em>.</p>

        <p><strong>Columbia Daily Tribune</strong> An afternoon paper, its website updates at 2 p.m. Located at 101 N. Fourth St. Note the “Daily.” On second reference, use <em>the Tribune</em>. Do not capitalize “the.” </p>
        <p><strong>Columbia Fire Department</strong> <em>Fire Department</em> or <em>the department</em> is acceptable on second reference, but <em>Fire Department</em> must be capitalized when used.</p>
        <p><strong>Columbia Housing Authority</strong> On second reference, use <em>Housing Authority</em> or <em>the authority</em>. It operates and sets rental rates for city housing projects for low-income, elderly and disabled people.</p>

        <p><strong>Columbia Planning and Zoning Commission</strong> On second reference, use <em>the commission</em>. Nine members sit on this panel, which approves and denies zoning requests for land inside the city boundary. <em>P&Z</em> is acceptable in headlines but not in a story. The commission meets at 7 p.m. every other Thursday.</p>
        <p><strong>Columbia Police Department</strong> On second reference, use <em>Police Department</em>, <em>police</em> (plural) or <em>the department</em>, but <em>Police Department</em> must be capitalized when used. <em>CPD</em> is not ideal. <em>Columbia police</em> refers to the officers, so “police” should be lowercase. Be sure to distinguish between MU and Columbia police when confusion is likely. Use <em>police officer(s)</em> instead of “policeman,” “policewoman,” “policemen” or “policewomen.” See <strong>MU Police Department</strong> or <strong>police</strong> for more information.</p>
        <p><strong>Columbia Public Library</strong> Many meetings are held in the library, located at 100 W. Broadway. Although the building houses the headquarters of the Daniel Boone Regional Library, it should be referred to only as the <em>Columbia Public Library</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Columbia Regional Airport</strong> Located about 10 miles south of Columbia on U.S. 63. Use <em>the airport</em> on second reference. American Airlines, its only current commercial tenant, flies to the Dallas/Fort Worth and Chicago O’Hare international airports from Columbia. <em>Dallas/Fort Worth</em>, <em>Chicago</em> or <em>Chicago O’Hare</em> are acceptable for all references. Always use <em>American Airlines</em>, never just "American.” Capitalize “flight" when it appears before a number identifying a specific route: <em>American Airlines Flight 3621</em>, <em>Flight 3624 to Dallas/Fort Worth</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Columbia Regional Hospital</strong> Purchased July 23, 1999, by the UM System. Located at 404 Keene St., the hospital used to be privately owned by Tenet.</p>
        <p><strong>the Columns</strong> Capitalize when referring to the six Ionic columns located on <strong>Francis Quadrangle</strong>. Note the lowercase “the.” Columbia has designated Eighth Street, which runs from Francis Quadrangle to the Boone County Courthouse with its four Doric columns, <em>Avenue of the Columns</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>commas</strong> Below is an incomplete list of the ways in which to use commas. For further guidelines, refer to the AP Stylebook.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To separate all but the last two elements in a simple series: <em>KCOU, MUTV and The Maneater are all student media outlets</em>.</li>
            <li>To separate two “equal” adjectives between which you could put the word “and” without affecting meaning: <em>There is a tall, skinny man over there. He is wearing a large gray jacket.</em></li>
            <li>To separate two independent clauses linked by a coordinating conjunction such as “but” or “and”: <em>The Maneater released an issue, and students read it.</em> Note that an independent clause and a dependent clause do not need a comma to separate them: <em>Students said Pavilion at Dobbs was good but also quite dirty. Students said Pavilion at Dobbs was good, but they said it was also quite dirty.</em> An exception to this rule can be made if the dependent clause is long or could obscure meaning if there is no comma.</li>
            <li>To set off years and state or country names after city names: <em>Mizzou played North Carolina on Dec. 26, 2011, in Shreveport, Louisiana, a neutral site.</em></li>
            <li>After introductory phrases longer than one word: <em>Last month, the robbers struck for the first time. Tomorrow they will appear in court.</em></li>
            <li>Before an attribution: <em>Men in government jobs were paid better than women last year, according to the report. “That’s a problem,” Mayor Louise Jefferson said.</em></li>
            <li>To set off a nonessential phrase or clause: <em>Chairman Bill Vega said the budget would be finalized Monday.</em> (Knowing the chairman’s name is essential.) <em>The Budget Committee chairman, Bill Vega, said the budget would be finalized Monday.</em> (Because there is only one Budget Committee chairman, knowing his name is not essential.) <em>The residents who live in the floodplain are angry.</em> (Knowing the residents live in the floodplain is essential to understanding that they are angry.) <em>The residents, who live in the valley, are angry.</em> (Knowing the residents live in the valley is not essential to understanding that they are angry.)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Exceptions to these rules can be made when an editor believes them to be necessary for clarity or otherwise helpful to the reader.</p>
        <p><strong>commencement</strong> Always use lowercase form. MU has commencement at the end of the winter and fall semesters. It no longer holds a commencement ceremony in August. If referring to commencement ceremonies at another university, check to see if it uses “graduation” instead.</p>
        <p><strong>Committee on Student Organizations, Governments and Activities</strong> The proper second reference is <em>the committee</em>, unless the story talks about multiple committees. In that case, or if used in a headline, use <em>SOGA</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>committees</strong> Capitalize names of standing committees. In government stories, capitalize if it is part of a formal name: <em>Senate Judiciary Committee, House Banking Subcommittee.</em></p>
        <p><strong>community adviser</strong> Note the “-er” ending of “adviser.” Community advisers work for the <strong>Department of Residential Life</strong> and live with students in the residence halls. The abbreviation is <em>CA</em>, and the plural form is <em>CAs</em>. Avoid this abbreviation, and never abbreviate on first reference except in headlines. Do not confuse with <strong>peer adviser</strong> or <strong>leadership adviser</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>CoMo</strong> Acceptable in MOVE Magazine content, but not in content for The Maneater.</p>
        <p><strong>COMO Connect</strong> Public city bus system with 11 routes formerly known as Columbia Transit. Note the capitalization of “COMO.” Operates the “Tiger Line” shuttle services to outer regions of campus and parking lots. The primary bus stop on campus is across from the Student Center on Rollins Street.</p>
        <p><strong>Concerned Student 1950</strong> Black student movement that formed in fall 2015 with the goal of improving campus' race climate and led to UM System President Tim Wolfe's resignation. There are 11 original members, including <strong>Jonathan Butler</strong>, who launched an anti-Wolfe hunger strike. Do not use as a hashtag in a story.</p>
        <p><strong>congressional districts</strong> There are eight in Missouri. Always use numeral form and capitalize “district” when referring to specific districts: <em>the 8th District.</em> U.S. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., represents the 4th District, which includes Boone County.</p>
        <p><strong>contractions</strong> Avoid excessive use.</p>
        <p><strong>Copper Beech Townhomes</strong> Note the spelling of “beech.” Located off Old 63 South just north of Grindstone Avenue. Use <em>Copper Beech</em> on second reference.</p>
        <p><strong>The Cottages</strong> Luxury housing located on East Nifong Boulevard. </p>
        <p><strong>counties</strong> There are 114 in Missouri in addition to the city of St. Louis, which is a separate entity under state law. Always capitalize <em>county</em> when used with the full name: <em>I live in Boone County, but my permanent residence is in another county.</em></p>
        <p><strong>courtesy titles</strong> As a rule, do not use courtesy titles, even when referring to a medical doctor. <em>This is an exception to AP style.</em> In stories where more than one person of the same last name is quoted or referred to, use first and last names, not courtesy titles, to avoid confusion. Exception: In obituaries, use courtesy titles on second and subsequent references to the dead. Exception: In obituaries, use “the Rev.” to denote a reverend: <em>the Rev. Godis Good.</em></p>
        <p><strong>courts</strong> See <strong>Boone County Circuit Court</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Craft Studio</strong> Recreational art facility located in Memorial Union North. Host of “crafternoons.”</p>
        <p><strong>Crime Stoppers</strong> A private organization that awards money to tipsters.</p>
        <p><strong>cutlines</strong> Cutlines should be more than one sentence. The first sentence should be written in present tense. The second sentence is usually written in past tense and should add information not in the photo: <em>Junior forward Bob Brown passes the ball during Friday’s game against Nebraska. The Tigers won the game 89-87.</em> Cutlines should add to the picture, not state the obvious. Wrong: <em>President Barack Obama speaks to students at a meeting.</em> Right: <em>President Barack Obama addresses the perils of jaywalking at Friday’s lecture. Obama addressed more than 100 students in Jesse Hall.</em></p>
        <p>Cutlines should be accurate. Cutline proofs are printed with the picture for a reason: Look at the picture and make sure the action is accurately reflected in the cutline. In sports pictures, passes can look like receptions and swings can look like misses. Be careful. Check all names, titles and ages. As in any article, all information should be checked for accuracy. If there is an article running with the picture, pull up the latest version and check to make sure the information matches up. <strong>Warning:</strong> If there is a discrepancy between the article and the picture, do not assume the reporter is correct. Try to verify the information yourself first, then call both the photographer and the reporter to have them check their notes. Don’t be afraid to call. If you are unsure of a name or fact, call the photographer or the assigning editor. If you want to verify something about a business or person and it is relatively early, call the business or person. If information is wrong, a source would rather be called late than not at all.</p>
        <p>Above all, remember that photographs can libel just as easily as articles, if not more so: A picture of Lisa smoking a cigarette with a cutline that reads, “MU junior Lisa Libel smokes a cigarette. Chain smokers have few friends and usually smoke marijuana, a new study suggests,” could be libelous if Lisa only smokes three cigarettes a day. Look closely, be accurate and be fair. Don’t be afraid to raise questions, and always edit cutlines just as carefully as articles.</p>
        <h5 id="D">D</h5>

        <p><strong>datelines</strong> Only use a dateline if a Maneater reporter files a story from another city. Datelines should contain a city name in all capitals, followed by the state, country or territory where the city is located, followed by an em dash (shift+option+dash): <em>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — (Story starts here).</em> Check AP for national cities that do not require a specific state after them, such as: <em>Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas</em>. Although the AP eliminated the use of state abbreviations in body text in 2014, abbreviations are still used in datelines: <em>TUSCALOOSA, Ala</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>dates</strong> Never abbreviate days of the week. Do not abbreviate a month unless it has a date with it: <em>February 1996; Feb. 14, 1996</em>. The five <strong>months</strong> spelled with five or fewer letters are never abbreviated. Set off the year with commas in the month-date-year construction: <em>Missouri will play BYU on Nov. 14, 2015, in Kansas City.</em> Never separate a month and a year with a comma: <em>September 1955</em>. Always use the time-date-place sequence: <em>The Tigers will have their first public practice at 4 p.m. Sep. 1, 2015, at Hearnes Center.</em> Use “on” only to avoid confusion between proper nouns: <em>The Tigers play Monday. The Tigers play the Jayhawks on Monday.</em> To indicate a range of dates, use <em>to</em> or <em>through</em> between the dates, never a hyphen. <em>Fourth of July</em> is written out.</p>
        <p><strong>dean</strong> A dean oversees a specific <strong>college</strong> or <strong>school</strong> at MU and is in charge of the faculty for that college or school. They report to the <strong>provost</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>dean’s list</strong> Note the lowercase “dean’s.” Each college has its own dean's list (as each college has its own dean).</p>
        <p><strong>death</strong> Use <em>died</em>, not any euphemisms such as "passed away.” Report cause of death. Identify the deceased by their city and state when possible. See <strong>obituaries</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>The Den</strong> Student housing complex located at 1412 Grindstone Plaza Drive in southern Columbia, opened fall 2014. Developed and owned by Texas-based Asset Campus Housing. </p>
        <p><strong>Department of Residential Life</strong> <em>ResLife</em> (never <em>Res Life</em>) is acceptable in headlines and on second reference. <em>Residential Life</em> is also acceptable, and often preferable, on subsequent references. Frankie Minor is the current director.</p>
        <p><strong>departments</strong> Academic departments and <strong>athletics department</strong> are not capitalized: <em>physics department.</em> MSA and university administrative departments are capitalized: <em>Department of Student Life, MSA Department of Student Services.</em></p>
        <p><strong>disability</strong> Do not identify a person as having a disability unless it is relevant. A person <em>has a disability</em> but is not “disabled.” Avoid using adjectives such as “disabled.” Never use “handicapped.” Use specific and straightforward language and terminology to avoid using potentially offensive general terms. Describe individuals who use wheelchairs as <em>wheelchair users</em>. Use <em>deaf</em> as lowercase. Avoid using phrases such as “suffers from” that suggest pity.</p>
        <p><strong>The District</strong> Only use in quotes. This name was given to Columbia’s downtown area as part of a PR campaign. Refer to the area as <em>downtown</em>. The campaign is composed of two organizations: the Columbia Special Business District and the Central Columbia Association. Not to be confused with the <em>North Village Arts District</em>, which is composed of businesses related to and supportive of the arts.</p>
        <p><strong>District Flats</strong> Luxury student housing complex built by Opus on South Eighth Street. Opened in fall 2015.</p>
        <p><strong>Division of Information Technology</strong> The <em>Division of Information Technology</em> is MU’s computing services body. Use full title on first reference. <em>DoIT</em> may be used in headlines and on second reference. When dealing with stories that discuss IT at any length, avoid jargon when possible. Do not use “UC” for a user consultant; refer to them only as <em>consultants</em> unless other types of consultants are mentioned in the story. See <strong>Webmail</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>DJ</strong> Acceptable in all references instead of “disc jockey.”</p>
        <p><strong>The Domain</strong> Luxury student housing complex located on Stadium Boulevard near U.S. 63.</p>

        <p><strong>ellipses</strong> Use an ellipsis (…) to indicate a portion of a quote has been omitted. Include a space before and after: <em>“Victims don’t have to have perfect judgment … to come forward and hold someone accountable,” Sen. McCaskill said.</em> Use only when necessary.</p>
        <p><strong>Ellis Fischel Cancer Center</strong> Center for cancer research and therapy located on the first two floors of the University Hospital patient care tower at 1 Hospital Drive. On second reference, use <em>the center</em>. If the story references Boone Hospital Center or other health care locations, use <em>Ellis Fischel</em>. <em>Fischel</em> and <em>cancer center</em> are acceptable in headlines. Relocated from its former building on Business Loop 70 (now Mizzou North) in 2013.</p>
        <p><strong>Ellis Library</strong> MU’s main library. Named after Elmer Ellis, MU's president from 1955-1963.</p>

        <p><strong>Environmental Leadership Office</strong> Separate from the Sustainability Office and located in the Student Center. Runs the Bike Share program, ELO Ambassadors and others. <em>ELO</em> is acceptable on second reference; <em>the office</em> is not.</p>
        <p><strong>em dash</strong> Use em dashes (—) to separate out clauses and phrases in sentences. Use them sparingly. Often, a comma or colon will work just as well. They are most accepted when the dependent clause it offsets uses commas. An em dash cannot be used to join two independent clauses. Em dashes are also used in bylines for briefs or letters, as well as in attributions for pull quotes. To create an em dash, hold down the shift and option keys, then press the dash key. Include a space before and after the dash. Note that an en dash (–), hyphen (-) and double hyphen (--) are not interchangeable.</p>
        <p><strong>email</strong> Not “e-mail.” See <strong>attribution</strong>.</p>

        <h5 id="F">F</h5>

        <p><strong>For All We Call Mizzou</strong> Always put this $1 billion fundraising drive in quotation marks. Launched by Chancellor Brady Deaton, it entered its public phase in 2003 with a gala on Francis Quadrangle. No previous fundraising drive, which includes donations to all academic departments and the athletics department, has matched or exceeded “For All We Call Mizzou.” Two of the three largest donations in MU’s history — $30 million to the School of Journalism and $10 million to the athletics department — were part of this drive. The drive reached its goal in 2008.</p>

        <p><strong>fractions</strong> Use words when the number is less than one and numbers when it is more than one: <em>two-thirds of the votes, 3 1/4 grams.</em> Consult the AP Stylebook for when it is appropriate to use decimals instead of fractions.</p>
        <p><strong>Francis Quadrangle</strong> Grassy area north of Jesse Hall upon which the Columns stand. Officially the David. R. Francis Quadrangle, named after the Missouri governor who fought to keep MU in Columbia following the devastating Academic Hall fire, <em>Francis Quadrangle</em> is suitable on first reference. On second reference and in headlines, use <em>the Quad</em>. Francis’ bust looks across the Quad from its position near Jesse Hall and provides students with good luck on exams.</p>
        <p><strong>Fraternity Row</strong> Beta Sigma Psi, Kappa Alpha Order, Sigma Chi, Beta Theta Pi, Alpha Gamma Rho, and Sigma Nu form Fraternity Row, which runs down College Avenue. Never "Frat Row."</p>
        <p><strong>fraternities</strong> Do not put “fraternity” after the chapter’s name on first reference unless it is part of the title, as with <strong>National Pan-Hellenic Council</strong> fraternities. Do not abbreviate names of fraternities on second reference, but “Fraternity Inc.” may be omitted after NPHC chapter names on second reference. Refer to all Greek organizations as chapters, not houses. Do not confuse chapters with colonies and interest groups; for clarification, see <strong>colony</strong> and <strong>interest group</strong>. All fraternities are members of a council. These councils include the <strong>Interfraternity Council</strong>, the <strong>Multicultural Greek Council</strong> and the NPHC.</p>
        <p>MU has 31 IFC fraternities: Acacia, Alpha Chi Rho, Alpha Epsilon Pi, Alpha Gamma Rho, Alpha Gamma Sigma, Alpha Kappa Lambda, Alpha Tau Omega, Beta Sigma Psi, Beta Theta Pi, Delta Chi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta Sigma Phi, Delta Tau Delta, Delta Upsilon, FarmHouse, Kappa Alpha Order, Kappa Sigma, Lambda Chi Alpha, Lambda Theta Phi, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Kappa Theta, Pi Kappa Alpha, Pi Kappa Phi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Chi, Sigma Nu, Sigma Phi Delta, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Sigma Pi, Sigma Tau Gamma, Tau Kappa Epsilon and Theta Chi. </p>

        <p><strong>Frederick Douglass High School</strong> Columbia’s non-traditional high school. Located at 310 N. Providence Road. Mascot is the Bulldogs. <em>Douglass High School</em> is acceptable on first reference.</p>
        <p><strong>freshman</strong> Use when referring to the <em>freshman class</em> or in reference to a specific person. Use <em>freshmen</em> as a plural noun.</p>
        <p><strong>Freshman Interest Group</strong> Note the singular “freshman.” A Freshman Interest Group consists of first-year students who live in the same residence hall and take many of the same classes first semester. <em>FIG</em> or <em>FIGs</em> is acceptable on second reference.

        <h5 id="G">G</h5>

        <p><strong>Gaines/Oldham Black Culture Center</strong> Officially called the Lloyd L. Gaines-Marian O’Fallon Oldham Black Culture Center. On second reference, use <em>the center</em>. <em>BCC</em> is undesirable except in quotes.</p>
        <p><strong>gay, lesbian, bisexual</strong> See <strong>LGBTQ community</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>gender</strong> Does not equate to sex. Do not use the terms “men and women” and “males and females” interchangeably. Remember, sex is what’s in your pants (which is rarely relevant to the story) and gender is what pants you wear.</p>
        <p><strong>gender terms</strong> The general rule of thumb is to use specific terms and avoid the “-person” suffix when the gender of the person is binary: <em>spokesman, spokeswoman; chairman, chairwoman</em>. For gender nonbinary individuals, use the “-person” suffix: <em>spokesperson</em>. Exception: use <em>chair</em> instead of "chairperson." In some cases, however, gender-neutral terms are appropriate or accepted for all references: <em>council member, firefighter, postal worker</em>. When speaking in a general sense (without referring to a specific person), avoid common terms that end in “-man”: <em>That duty belongs to salespeople</em> (not “salesmen”)<em>; He is a salesman; She is a saleswoman</em>. Exception: <em>Layman’s terms</em> is acceptable, but not appreciated because it is a cliche. Exception: Use either <em>chairs</em> or <em>chairmen</em> when a more relevant term is not available because “chairpeople” sounds too much like a low-budget horror film.</p>

        <p><strong>Graduate School</strong> Use in all references to the Graduate School at MU. All students seeking master’s and doctoral degrees here are enrolled in the Graduate School; therefore, someone is a <em>graduate student in journalism</em>, not a “student in the Graduate School of Journalism.”</p>
        <p><strong>graphics</strong> Headlines should be in all caps. Composition titles, such as in MOVE graphics, should be in single quotes. The source tag should be written: <em>Source: (Insert source here).</em> Don't capitalize anything in a source that isn't a proper noun or a title. Sports graphics do not need sources. AP and Maneater style apply to all graphics, especially in time-date-place situations. The byline should be in the bottom-right corner of the graphics box: <em>(NAME)/GRAPHIC DESIGNER.</em></p>
        <p><strong>graduate student</strong> Always use this term, never “grad student,” “med student,” “law student” or the like. Only specify the graduate program when it is relevant to the story.</p>
        <p><strong>Greek</strong> Always capitalize. Do not, however, refer to a Greek student as “a Greek.” Instead, use <em>member of Greek Life</em> or specify their affiliation.</p>
        <p><strong>Greek Judicial Board</strong> Always use on first reference. <em>Greek board</em> is acceptable in headlines; “J-board” is never acceptable. It is a board of 12 Greek students who hear cases involving violations made by entire Greek Life chapters against chapter laws and M-Book regulations. It consists of five justices from the Panhellenic Council, five from the Interfraternity Council and two from the National Pan-Hellenic Council.</p>
        <p><strong>Greek Life</strong> When referring to the office in the MU Student Center, use <em>Office of Greek Life</em>. Lowercase “life” when using in a general sense: <em>The Rolling Stone article degraded Greek life.</em></p>

        <p><strong>Greek Week</strong> Held annually during the spring semester. A themed month-long series of events, service projects and competitions for fraternity and sorority pairings to raise money for charities in mid-Missouri.

Foley was previously the senior vice chancellor for research and graduate studies.</p>
        <p><strong>Hatch Hall graffiti incident</strong> Use to refer to the act of vandalism that occurred outside of Hatch Hall on Feb. 12, 2011, which led to the creation of the student-led <strong>One Mizzou</strong> diversity initiative. When describing the crime, use <em>racist</em> or <em>racially-charged graffiti message</em>. The graffiti itself is not racist.</p>
        <p><strong>Hearnes Center</strong> Hosts Missouri volleyball, gymnastics and wrestling, and formerly hosted basketball before the 2004 construction of Mizzou Arena. Not “Warren E. Hearnes Multipurpose Building” or any other derivation. Not “the Hearnes Center.”</p>
        <p><strong>heights</strong> Use figures and spell out words that indicate dimension, such as <em>feet</em>, <em>yards</em> and <em>inches</em>. Never use apostrophes for feet and inches (i.e. 5'7"). Hyphenate adjective forms before nouns: <em>It was an 8-inch clock. The road was 12 1/2 feet wide. He is 6-foot-4. She is 5 feet 7 inches tall.</em> See <strong>dimensions in the AP Stylebook</strong> for more information.</p>
        <p><strong>Hickman High School</strong> Officially "David H. Hickman High School." Located at 1104 N. Providence Road. Sports teams are the Kewpies.</p>
        <p><strong>highways</strong> Federal highways other than interstates should be referred to as <em>U.S. 63</em>, <em>U.S. 54</em>, etc. State highways are <em>Missouri 163</em>, <em>Missouri 740</em>, etc. Within Columbia city limits, use the city street designations for these highways. County-maintained roads usually have letter designations but should be referred to by their city street names when within Columbia: Route B is <em>Paris Road</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>his or her</strong> Use <em>their</em> when speaking in general and not referring to a specific person. “His or her” excludes some gender nonbinary individuals.</p>
        <p><strong>HIV/AIDS</strong> Use unless specifically referencing one of the components. Never use the term "full-blown AIDS." People don’t die of AIDS; they die of <em>AIDS-related illnesses</em>. Better yet, put the actual disease, and then if necessary, later write: <em>Mr. Smith had AIDS.</em></p>
        <p><strong>HIV-positive, HIV-negative</strong> The Human Immunodeficiency Virus is the virus that causes AIDS. Although there is a test that measures the presence of HIV in a person’s blood, the terms <em>HIV-positive</em> and <em>HIV-negative</em> refer to the results of tests that measure antibodies in the blood. A person can be HIV-positive and not have AIDS. Avoid redundancy like “HIV virus.” No one dies from HIV. They die from <em>AIDS-related illnesses</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Homecoming</strong> Use as one word and always capitalize when referring to MU Homecoming events, which are held each fall. However, use the lowercase form when referring to other schools’ homecomings and in reference to the general idea of homecoming: <em>The first homecoming in the Midwest was held at MU.</em></p>
        <p><strong>honestly</strong> Use sparingly in columns. The word emphasizes the honesty of one statement at the expense of all other statements. Removal typically does not modify sentence meaning.</p>
        <p><strong>Honors College</strong> Use in all references to the MU Honors College, located on Lowry Hall. Use <em>the college</em> on second reference if it is the only university college referred to in the story.</p>
        <p><strong>Hy-Vee</strong> Three locations in Columbia: 3100 W. Broadway, 405 E. Nifong Blvd. and 25 Conley Road. This Iowa-based grocery chain opened its first Columbia store in 2001.</p>
        <p><strong>hyphens</strong> Use hyphens in compound modifiers, which occur when two or more words work together to modify a noun. Do not hyphenate “very” or adverbs ending with “-ly”: <em>a well-known man, a very careless mistake.</em> Refer to the <strong>AP Stylebook punctuation section</strong> for rules for specific words. Although absurd amounts of hyphens can be grammatically correct, do not over-hyphenate, except with lighthearted purposes in MOVE style. Hyphenated phrases like “Dr.-Jekyll-and-Mr.-Hyde quality” will be killed on sight. Rephrase to avoid over-hyphenating.</p>
        <p><strong>hyperlinks</strong> Use hyperlinks in online stories to provide background information and further reading, but format the story such that clicking on a link is not essential to understanding relevant details of a story. A reader might not click on the link or the Web page might become available, so don’t use a link as an excuse to exclude information from your story. Also, adding too many links can become distracting and unuseful. When available, always preference previous Maneater reports for background.</p>
        <p>To format a hyperlink in an online story, use this format, omitting the spaces: <em><a href="full URL, including http:// or https://"> text link</a></em> Where including a Web page in print is necessary, write the simplest top level address possible, omitting “www” or any other subdomain unless absolutely necessary: <em>Visit themaneater.com/about for more information.</em> When referencing information found on a source’s website, always link to the public page where that information is available, not just the home page: <em>… according to [ the MSA bylaws ] ( http://msa.missouri.edu/bylaws ).</em> Watch for phrases like “according to its website” or “according to its Facebook page” that create a hyperlink expectation. Hyperlinks are a great story supplement, but reporters must still strive to obtain and confirm information with human sources.</p>
        <h5 id="I">I</h5>

        <p><strong>Intercampus Faculty Council</strong> The Intercampus Faculty Council consists of representatives from the UM System’s four campuses’ faculty councils.

        <p><strong>Internet (noun); internet (adjective)</strong> See <strong>web</strong> and <strong>online</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Interstate 70</strong> Always write out on first reference; on second reference, use <em>I-70</em>. This rule applies to all interstate highways but does not apply to I-70 Drive. <em>Business Loop 70</em> should be spelled out.</p>
        <h5 id="J">J</h5>

        <p><strong>J-School</strong> Use only in headlines. Always capitalize the “J.” In copy, use <em>Missouri School of Journalism</em> on first reference and <em>the school</em> or <em>the journalism school</em> on second reference.</p>
        <p><strong>J-Slums</strong> To endearingly refer to the apartment buildings at 400 and 402 S. Ninth St., <em>the J-Slums</em> is appropriate.

        <p><strong>The Maneater</strong> The official, editorially independent student news source of MU since 1955, when sociology student <strong>Joel Gold</strong> took the Missouri Student from Delta Upsilon and renamed it to reflect a more aggressive news angle. Its official slogan, “You’ve been warned,” comes from the editorial policy penned by Gold in its first issue. All members of the editorial and business staffs are MU students, and its leaders are elected democratically, with the exception of a professional business adviser. The Maneater’s print edition is published weekly on Wednesdays during the spring and fall semesters, and online content is posted to its website almost daily. Note the uppercase “T,” which is to be used in all references to the publication, except when used as an adjective. In stories referencing current or recent members of its staff (including editors), use the distinction <em>of The Maneater staff</em> or <em>formerly of The Maneater staff</em>, but avoid these sources unless absolutely necessary.</p>
        <p>Founded as the <em>Missouri Student</em> in 1933, The Maneater is affiliated with the Department of Student Life. The UM System Board of Curators, legal publisher of The Maneater, delegates oversight to the MU Student Publications Board. It was the publications board that asked Gold to run for editor after a string of editors from Delta Upsilon had turned the paper into a “Greek rag.” Technically speaking, “maneater” is a term for a tiger who has developed a taste for humans. It is also a derogatory term for Native Americans. More recently, the term has been used to refer to women who enjoy the sexual company of many male partners. Refer to the songs by Hall & Oates and Nelly Furtado for more information. Gold merely thought “maneater” sounded like an edgy name at the time.</p>

        <p><strong>mental illness</strong> A person <em>has a mental illness</em> but should never be described as “mentally ill.” Avoid using adjectives, especially general ones. Use specific and straightforward language and terminology. Avoid using phrases such as “suffers from” that suggest pity. Most mental illnesses are not capitalized. Refer to the AP Stylebook for further details.</p>
        <p><strong>Middlebush Hall</strong> Middlebush Hall is located on the corner of Ninth Street and University Avenue. It was home to the College of Business until Fall Semester 2002.

Accuracy is an important aspect of writing an obituary. It’s hard to do, but you must call a family member to verify information and personalize the article. There is no second chance. Try to humanize the story whenever possible with information about his or her work and hobbies. Talk to family members, friends and co-workers.</p>

        <p><strong>police</strong> Use lowercase form when writing <em>Columbia police</em>, <em>MU police</em>, <em>the police</em> or <em>police said</em>.

        <h5 id="Q">Q</h5>

        <p><strong>quotes</strong> Stories should have three quoted sources. Before any phrase goes into quotes, it must be checked for accuracy.

Always use the format: <em>“Everyone gets a tiger,” Tim Noce said. “You get a tiger. And you get a tiger.”</em></p>
